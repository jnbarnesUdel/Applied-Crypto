To run this code Qustion one must first be compiled with:
gcc Question1.c -lssl -lcrypto

it must then be run with:
curl 'https://www.random.org/cgi-bin/randbyte?nbytes=50&format=h' | ./a.out

The curl is needed to fetch the bits from random.org and pipe them into the program

Question two can be compiled normaly like:
gcc Question2.c

then run normaly like:
./a.out
